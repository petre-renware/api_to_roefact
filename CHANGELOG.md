-
* ... future intention is to make commands:
    * `config` - new... to set INTERACTIVELY configuration options (HINT: to use `Rich prompt`)
    * `xl2json - wip... RDINV` read Excel data and crate a JSON file (with map to convert to RO-EFact XML) with invoice data,
    * `json2xml - WRXML`,
    * `json2pdf` - new...,
    * `xml2roefact - LDXML`
    * create a **`build.bat`** & include in `MSI` package 'data' directories as: `excel_invoice_template/`, empty `invoice_files/` (see `cx-Freeze`, options `--directories` of `bdist_msi`cmd, option `--include_files` of `build_exe`cmd, ref URL: `https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_script.html`)
    * other commands enumerated on `https://apitoroefact.renware.eu/commercial_agreement/110-SRE-api_to_roefact_requirements.html#componenta-xl2roefact`
    * FINISHING_SOLUTION_TBD:
        * [ ] consider refactor `xl2roefact` --> `xl-invoices` (hyphen as PEP 503 `https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/#normalized-names`) ...
        * [ ] && publish `xl2roefact` package --> read `TODO_packaging.md`
-
* -#NOTE_PLAN_tbd... RDINV module ...just read file and identify big zones:
    * invoice header
        * [x] (DONE@0.1.12) invoice header - invoice number
        * [x] (DONE@231217piu_a) invoice header - issue date
        * [x] (DONE@0.1.13) invoice header - currency
        * [ ] invoice header - supplier (`<cac:AccountingSupplierParty>`)
        * [ ] invoice header - customer (`<cac:AccountingCustomerParty>`)



### 0.1.15 invoice issue date  (#TODO_WIP...)

* wip... WHEN RELEASE UPDATE `pyproject.toml`

* tbd... make a PDM build (helper `https://backend.pdm-project.org/build_config/`)


* 231219piu_a update `rdinv.__get_excel_data_at_label(...)` to return found label value in dictionary as key `"label_value"`

* 231218piu_c `PDM` environment manager, updated `pyproject.toml` structures ref package building, still preps to create env, generate lock file...

* 231218piu_b CLI application, fixed bug of print settings when deployed from a package (command: `xl2roefact.py settings`)

* 231218piu_a installed `PDM` environment manager, updated `pyproject.toml` structures, nxt to create env, generate lock file...






### 0.1.14 invoice issue date  (231217 h07:00)

* 231217piu_b build packages for:
    * [x] application deployment package ==> `dist/0.1.13-xl2roefact-0.1-win64.msi`
    * [x] cleaned, tested, created packages (saved to ==> `.../880-RLSE/880.90-RLSE Source Code Archives`)
    * [x] updated `pyproject.toml`

* 231217piu_a invoice header, issue date (&& ATTN pendulum raise error, see `rdinv.py` line #17, ==> MAYBE JUST TRY `Arrow` or standard `datetime`)

* 231216piu_a review, improve & clean code for: `xl_invoices/config_settings.py`, `xl_invoices/rdinv.py`

* 231215piu_b FIXED configs loaded from config_settings: `rdinv` module load (init) all constants as global variables (because they are subject to change / "improve" values as reading Excel file, for example `DEFAULT_CURRENCY`)

* 231215piu_a changed dir name **`xl_invoice_modules/`** to `xl_invoices` or classic `xl2roefact`  as this will be the package name. This is a Python official RECOMMENDATION not a constraint

* 231214piu_a made xl2roefact Python standard package (moved `xl2roefact` modules to a dedicated directory (`xl_invoice_modules/`) with intention to publish package)

* 231212piu_a `rdinv.rdinv()` invoice header, invoice number as: `{"value": ..., "location": (row..., col...)}`

* 231211piu_b `rdinv.rdinv()` create a function special to get "one key Excel values", like invoice number or invoice issue date.  Signature:
    - `pattern_to_search_for: list[str]` - for inv number will pass the `PATTERN_FOR_INVOICE_NUMBER_LABEL`
    - `area_to_scan: list[start_cell, end_cell]` - for inv number will pass `(invoice_header_area["start_cell"], invoice_header_area["end_cell"])`
    - targeted_tye: type - what type expect (will try to convert to, if cannot will return str)

* 231211piu_a updated `config_settings.py` ref how to find it: string labels to search, direction to search effective info starting from label

* 231210piu_a localized and marked areas for invoice header (`invoice_header_area`) & invoice footer (`invoice_footer_area`) ==> dicts for header and footer with structure `{ start_cell = (row, col), end_cell = (row, col) }`

* closed `231209piu_a` more actions:
    * changed `README.md`: translated to RO, updated installation & usage information
    * dropped old, obsolete deployment packages
    * test PASS

* 231208piu_b add an INVOICE TEMPLATE (`excel_invoice_template/invoice_template_CU_tva.xlsx`) as deliverable with application

* 231205piu_a change all solution to use `rich` library instead of `colorama` (Rich library ref `https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html`)
    * [x] drop all `from colorama import Fore, Back, Style`
    * [x] add new `from rich import print`
    * [x] update all places where `{Fore....}` with `[...]` as:
        * [x] `{Fore.YELLOW}` with `[yellow]`

* 231103piu_a `xl2roefact.py` more updates:
    * [x] set verbose flag for debugging mode
    * [x] made `file_name` argument as file(s) to be processed with wildcards like Python standard function `os.glob.glob()` (reference here `https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html`)
    * [x] build a new fresh executable in `build/exe.win-amd64-3.10/`

* 231202piu_b `xl2roefact.py` started a skeleton for `file_name` argument - see code-in-file @"TODO here to use `excel_files_directory` + / + `file_name` to find all files and process them in a loop"

* 231129piu_b updated `xl2roefact.py` (main application) changed command `run` --> `xl2json` and add parameter `excel_files_directory` (future intention is to make commands: `xl2json - RDINV`, `json2xml - WRXML`, `json2pdf`, `xml2roefact - LDXML`)

* 231129piu_a adopted new REN invoice template (test with data from RENF-1004)

* 231128piu_b made `config_settings.py` for general application configuration purposes and an application command (`xl2roefact settings`) to print them

* 231128piu_a made `xl2roefact.py` (main library file) as CLI executable structure (with `Typer` library)

* 231127piu_c introduced **key `Invoice`** in  invoice JSON generated structure (also representing the "entity" in XML representation)

* 231127piu_b module `rdinv` crated a distinct function for building of `meta_info` key (main `invoice` dictionary)
