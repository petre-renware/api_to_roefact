# xl2roefact component

[TOC]

This component is presented in document `.../doc_src/...110-SRE-api_to_roefact_requirements.md``




## Detailed technical documentation

Component detailed specifications can be found at [xxx](../doc_src/810-DSGN/810.05a-xl2roefact_component.md)




## Configuration & settings

Configuration constants and variables are placed in file **`config_settings.py`**. These are in Python form presented using constants PEP recommendations (all upper case) and accompanied by some help lines to understand and maintain them.








## Working directories

* __`invoice_files/`__ normal directory for Excel files to be processed (here will be searched Excel files if not foud in current directory)

* ___`build/<source-file-name>/` directory which will contain intermediary files usable when rebuilding CLI application

* ___`dist/<source-file-name>.exe`___ executable generated file (format Windows x86)

* __`test_data_and_specs_originals/`__ contains test invoices: from client, a RENware one, a 3rd party one:
    * __`specs/`__ contains specification documents + `_my_notes.md` with notes & comments made in analysis phase
    * __`fact_*/`__ original test invoices: from Kraftanlagen, from RENware, from 3rd party









## Creating and deploying component

### Building Windows executable

* Change to `base-proc/` directory
* Activate environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

* build packages with PDM:
    * **`pdm build_wheel`** build Python package,
    * **`pdm build_msi`** build MSI package,
    * **`pdm build_all`** build all packages

* build technical documentation
    * **`pdm build_doc`** build technical documentation. *NOTE-ATTN* name of markdown generated file


<small markdown="1">

!!! info "NOTE building packages options"
    In some cases may be useful to run basic-raw commands - here these are:
    * build MSI package: run __`python setup.py bdist_msi`__ which will build:
        * **`EXE`** (`build/bdist.win-amd64/`) and
        * **`MSI`** Windows install package (`dist/xl2roefact-0.1-win64.msi`)
        * as result will be created following directories with the `Windows` files for deployment:
        ```
        build/
            bdist.win-amd64/ - containing the msi type installer
            exe.win-amd64-3.10/ - containing the executable file(s)
        dist/
            xl2roefact-0.1-win64.msi - is the Windows installer
        ```
    * build PyPy package if needed: __`pdm build --no-clean`__
</small>


!!! warning "NOTE ref deployment to end users"
    * is recommended to assembly an archive file to be deployed as release package by `git` (anyway is recommended as executable and msi files could not be easily deployed or sent by e-mail)
    * MSI package is deployable itself (as-is)







## System modules

`xl2roefact` basic "active" modules (not package definition) are:

* `rdinv` read an Excel file and extract invoice data to a JSON file format
* `wrxml`  write, convert the JSON invoice file to a XML file format, respecting schemes required by *RO EFact* standard
* `chkxml` check generated XML file
* `ldxml` load an invoice (ie, its XML associated file) to *ANAF SPV system*
* `chkisld` check if an invoice is already loaded in *ANAF SPV system*
* `config_settings` define system settings & parameters mainly used in invoice info / data detection and extract from invoice Excel format file
* `app_cli` contains the code for `xl2roefact` application command line (CLI) format



Below are presented the skeleton logic those of modules where is relevant, meaning is not enough obvious from code or code complexity exceed usual limits (*for example nore than 100 lines of code per function*). For technical details and specification regarding modules see [810.05a-xl2roefact_DLD_specs.md file](./810.05a-xl2roefact_DLD_specs.md)
