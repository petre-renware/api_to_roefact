# xl2roefact component

[TOC]

This component is presented in document `.../doc_src/...110-SRE-api_to_roefact_requirements.md``



## [Detailed design technical documentation](./810.05a-xl2roefact_DLD_specs.md)



## Working directories

Below is a short description of most important directories that will (can !) be found on local development environment.

* __`invoice_files/`__ default directory for Excel files which is intended to be processed

* ___`build/` this directory which will contain intermediary files resulted from building CLI application, library distribution parts, etc. Directory is subject of `.gitignore`

* ___`dist/`___ package files (wheels, dist), Windows executables, etc, generally all files subject of "public" distribution and download

* __`test_*/`__ contains test invoice samples (from client, a RENware one, a 3rd party one) and some useful specs in dev & test process







<!--#FIXME chk if all the commands was noved as PDM scripts and droo it -->
## Creating and deploying component

### Building Windows executable

* Change to `base-proc/` directory
* Activate environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

* build packages with PDM:
    * **`pdm build_wheel`** build Python package,
    * **`pdm build_msi`** build MSI package,
    * **`pdm build_all`** build all packages

* build technical documentation
    * **`pdm build_doc`** build technical documentation. *NOTE-ATTN* name of markdown generated file


<small markdown="1">

!!! info "NOTE building packages options"
    In some cases may be useful to run basic-raw commands - here these are:
    * build MSI package: run __`python setup.py bdist_msi`__ which will build:
        * **`EXE`** (`build/bdist.win-amd64/`) and
        * **`MSI`** Windows install package (`dist/xl2roefact-0.1-win64.msi`)
        * as result will be created following directories with the `Windows` files for deployment:
        ```
        build/
            bdist.win-amd64/ - containing the msi type installer
            exe.win-amd64-3.10/ - containing the executable file(s)
        dist/
            xl2roefact-0.1-win64.msi - is the Windows installer
        ```
    * build PyPy package if needed: __`pdm build --no-clean`__
</small>


!!! warning "NOTE ref deployment to end users"
    * is recommended to assembly an archive file to be deployed as release package by `git` (anyway is recommended as executable and msi files could not be easily deployed or sent by e-mail)
    * MSI package is deployable itself (as-is)






<!--#FIXME at thw beginning of doc as a general description and 1st level breakdown of `xl2roefactPyPi` component (ie, a kind of "who's who") -->
## System modules

`xl2roefact` basic "active" modules (not package definition) are:

* `rdinv` read an Excel file and extract invoice data to a JSON file format
* `wrxml`  write, convert the JSON invoice file to a XML file format, respecting schemes required by *RO EFact* standard
* `chkxml` check generated XML file
* `ldxml` load an invoice (ie, its XML associated file) to *ANAF SPV system*
* `chkisld` check if an invoice is already loaded in *ANAF SPV system*
* `config_settings` define system settings & parameters mainly used in invoice info / data detection and extract from invoice Excel format file
* `app_cli` contains the code for `xl2roefact` application command line (CLI) format


Below are presented the ***skeleton logic*** of those modules where is relevant, meaning is not enough obvious from code or code complexity exceed usual limits (*for example nore than 100 lines of code per function*). For technical details and specification regarding modules see [810.05a-xl2roefact_DLD_specs.md file](./810.05a-xl2roefact_DLD_specs.md)


### rdinv module logic

Main function of `rdinv` module is `rdinv(...)` which has the following logic sections which are in ***strict sequence in presented order***:

* *search of `invoice_items_area` subtable*. This area is expected to contain invoice lines and is "processed" first because it is more structured and easier to identify; after its identification the header area is considered upper of it and footer area below it

* *solve `invoice_items_area` in 2 step...*. In this step the code-data-variables of items area will be initialized in order to hold information that will be found

* *localize and mark areas for...* section that follows natural the previous one by initializing code-data-variables forcheader and footer areas to hold their corresponding information

* *solve `invoice_header_area`* detailed initialize of header area code-data-variables

* *`ReNaSt`-RegNameStrategy* section that identify and extract the legal registered name of invoice customer

* ...wip... <!-- #FIXME here is a wip (@240115) area that need to be included after finish it -->

* *section to ( Excel data )--->( JSON ) format preparation and finishing* section which prepare Excel original data found to be be saved as JSON as a more "electronic interchangeable" structure
