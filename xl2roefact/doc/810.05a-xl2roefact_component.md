## Creating and deploying component

### Building Windows executable

* Change to `base-proc/` directory
* Activate environment: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`

* build packages with PDM:
    * **`pdm build_wheel`** build Python package,
    * **`pdm build_msi`** build MSI package,
    * **`pdm build_all`** build all packages

* build technical documentation
    * **`pdm build_doc`** build technical documentation. *NOTE-ATTN* name of markdown generated file

!!! info "NOTE building packages options"
    In some cases may be useful to run basic-raw commands - here these are:
    * build MSI package: run __`python setup.py bdist_msi`__ which will build:
        * **`EXE`** (`build/bdist.win-amd64/`) and
        * **`MSI`** Windows install package (`dist/xl2roefact-0.1-win64.msi`)
        * as result will be created following directories with the `Windows` files for deployment:
        ```
        build/
            bdist.win-amd64/ - containing the msi type installer
            exe.win-amd64-3.10/ - containing the executable file(s)
        dist/
            xl2roefact-0.1-win64.msi - is the Windows installer
        ```
    * build PyPy package if needed: __`pdm build --no-clean`__
</small>


!!! warning "NOTE ref deployment to end users"
    * is recommended to assembly an archive file to be deployed as release package by `git` (anyway is recommended as executable and msi files could not be easily deployed or sent by e-mail)
    * MSI package is deployable itself (as-is)
