# Structure

Structure to be includ as _invoice footer_ in XML format:

```xml
<cac:TaxTotal>
    <cbc:TaxAmount currencyID="RON">190.00</cbc:TaxAmount>
    <cac:TaxSubtotal>
        <cbc:TaxableAmount currencyID="RON">1000.00</cbc:TaxableAmount>
        <cbc:TaxAmount currencyID="RON">190.00</cbc:TaxAmount>
        <cac:TaxCategory>
            <cbc:ID>S</cbc:ID>
            <cbc:Percent>19.00</cbc:Percent>
            <cac:TaxScheme>
                <cbc:ID>VAT</cbc:ID>
            </cac:TaxScheme>
        </cac:TaxCategory>
    </cac:TaxSubtotal>
</cac:TaxTotal>
```

## Calculation of items

```python
cac_TaxTotal = {
    "cbc_TaxAmount": round(sum(cac_TaxSubtotal, 2),  #NOTE it is a summarization of next item which is a list (a detailed presentation of info)
    "cac_TaxSubtotal" = [{
        "cbc_TaxableAmount": rounded float,  # ...nxt.comments...
        # ... taxable vaue, is the value where the tax will be applied, the total value w/o VAT of an item
        # ... basically `tmp_InvoiceLine_list["cbc_LineExtensionAmount"]` which in code is constructed before reusable parts from `Invoice` "big" dict
        # ... detaild specs calculation:
        # SUM( tmp_InvoiceLine_list["cbc_LineExtensionAmount"])
        # WHERE tmp_InvoiceLine_list["cac_Item"]...
        # 

        "cbc_TaxAmount": rounded float,  # is the tax resulted from application on `cbc_TaxableAmount` === `LineVatAmount`
        # ...next one keys are just from peoduct line keys...
    },
    # {...},   ...another product iteration here, for prev_dict in Invoice big dict
]
#NOTE attn DON'T close last list line with comma `,`

}
```
