* TBD... mk dir ./xl2roefact/` as library shell ...
    * __OBIECTIV__ to mk `xl2roefact` package - KEEP IN MIND that CLI app MUST be deployed separatelyy anyway (pentru PFA-uri, sigur instaleaza MSI-ul si trebuie sa aiba toate directoarele acolo, dar trebuie sa fie si separat, deci MSIul si dist/ ramin)
    * [x] DONE@231214piu_a MOVE_in: `./invoice_files/.gitkeep`, './excel_invoice_template/*`, `./doc/MANPAGE_xl2roefact.txt`
          --> FROM NOW, library is 99% active (not published @ 231214) and can be used as part of whole `xl2roefact` system including CLI app
    * [ ] pay attn main `README...`
    * [ ] write "invoice filling rules" (these are in `config_settings.py`) ==> make a dedicated section in `./docs/`
