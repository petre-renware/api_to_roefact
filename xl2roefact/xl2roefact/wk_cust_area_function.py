# work area to clean and generalize a function to solve CUSTOMER INFO:
# -1. to replace as separated function the existing code for customer info
# -2. to generalize it to work for customer info, but a "CUSTOMER" op/cmd to be sent as parameter
# -3. to be able to work for op/cmd "SUPPLIER"
# -4. to be placed in `rdinv.py` module and to do work in new environment without disturbing it for existing functionalities
#     ... ie, to not induce lateral effects
