"""Layer 2 **commands** implementation.

Objectives:

* create an environment wheree a xl2roefact can be run in *session or interactivelly mode*
* session parameters: persist commands run parameters in user profile (directory of `os.%userprofile%` or Linux `~/.profile`)
* group all layer 2 commands for:
    * `xl2roefactd` (aka server)
    * `xl2roefact-client` (aka console client)
    * `web2roefact` (aka web client UI front end)* components
